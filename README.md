# Iris Flower Classifier

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Project Overview
The model uses the popular Iris dataset available in the scikit-learn library. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained to learn the relationships between input features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and the flower species.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Involved
1. Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
3. Train a Decision Tree Classifier.  
4. Evaluate the model’s accuracy.  
5. Take user input to predict the flower species.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.  
2. Run all cells in order.  
3. Enter flower measurements when prompted to get the prediction.

## Results
The model achieves around 95–98% accuracy on the test data.
